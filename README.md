# Analysis on Kickstarter Outcomes

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Completed analysis on Kickstarter data to find the likelihood of a campaignâ€™s successfulness based on different parameters. Found a correlation between launch date of campaigns and how successful those campaigns were. Examined the connection between the amount the campaign had set and the campaigns outcome.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For data in which months were successful vs failed I only looked at the theater category to get better idea of which months have a high chance to succeed. From the data we can that we can see that for the first 4 months of the year the successful campaigns are even. However, when we enter may the successful campaigns peak at a total of 111 successful and then in the following months after May it continues to decrease in number of successful campaigns. Whereas the lowest month of successful campaigns is in December with 37. Throughout the entire year the number of failed campaigns is relatively even. With a minimum of 31 failed in November and a maximum of 52 failing in May. There is at no point in the year where the number of successful campaigns is surpassed by the number of failed campaigns as showed by the chart linked below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The data shows that after a certain dollar amount the likelihood of a campaign to succeed drops drastically. Campaigns that had a goal of less than 1000-dollars and campaigns in the 1000-dollar to 4999-dollar range had a much high success rate. With them having a 76% and 73% success rate respectively. There is a 25% drop-in success rate when you enter the 10000-dollar to 19999-dollar brackets. All three ranges have a 50%-55% success rate. From that point the success rate continues to drop. However, at the 35000-Dollar to 44999-dollar brackets there is an increase in success rate. The percentage of success jumps to 67%. It is worth mentioning here that these two brackets only had 6 projects in the 35000-dollar to 39999-dollar range and 3 projects in the 40000-dollar to 44999-dollar range. Whereas the less than 1000-dollar bracket had 186 projects with the before mentioned 76% and the 1000-dollar to 4999-dollar bracket had 534 projects with 73% success rates. The chart linked below shows the decrease in success rate as the goal increases.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

During the completion of the challenge there was one section that I had an issue with, and it was the creation of the line chart for outcomes based on goals. I had an issue where there was a line for successful, canceled, and failed. However, I was able to get over those changes when I studied the properties of the chart and found I could sort out the lines I was not looking for. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  * There is a never a point where the failed campaigns surpass the successful campaigns.
  * The successful campaigns peak in May and then decline month over month for the rest of the year. 
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
